					<h3>What are Special Effects in movies</h3>
					<p class="intro">
						Special effects are techniques and technologies that create illusions or enhance visual elements in a movie. 
						Otherwise noted as SFX, these effects can be either practical or digital, and are used to add visual interest, 
						realism, or fantasy to a film. Practical special effects involve physical objects and techniques that are 
						captured on camera during filming. Examples of practical effects include makeup, prosthetics, animatronics, 
						miniatures, pyrotechnics, and more. These techniques have been used in filmmaking since its early days to 
						create illusions such as disappearing acts, explosions, or transforming characters.

					<h3>The history of Special Effects in Movies</h3>
					<p class="intro">
						The history of special effects in movies can be traced back to the early days of film industry. 
						Filmmakers began experimenting with various techniques to create illusions on screen. One of the earliest 
						examples of practical effects and trick photography can be seen in silent films. These relied heavily on 
						visual storytelling due to the lack of synchronized sound.
					</p>
					<h4 class="examples-topic">Examples of Special Effects in Early Movies</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>
							1) The Lost World (1925)
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								One of the earliest examples of special effects in movies is the 1925 silent film The Lost World. 
								The movie is based totally on a unique by way of Arthur Conan Doyle and it tells the tale of a 
								group of explorers who discover a prehistoric world in South America. The film features stop motion 
								animation by Willis O'Brien who would later go on to create the special effects for the 1933 film King Kong.
							</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							2) Star Wars (1977)
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								The 1977 film Star Wars is one of the most influential movies in the history of special effects. 
								That movie has ground-breaking special effects that raised the bar for crafting science fiction movies. 
								We discover just how challenging it was to create things like the aerial space battles in our analysis of 
								how Star Wars was shot. The movie's unique motion control cameras, miniatures, matte paintings, and practical 
								effects opened the path for further developments in visual effects.
							</p>	
						</dd>
						<dt>
							3) Jurassic Park (1993)
						</dt> 
						<dd>
							<p>
								The 1993 film Jurassic Park is another landmark film in the history of special effects. 
								The film was directed by Steven Spielberg and it featured groundbreaking visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic. 
								The film featured a combination of practical and digital effects to create the illusion of living dinosaurs. 
								The film also featured the first use of the Dinosaur Input Device (DID) which was used to control the movements of the dinosaurs.
							</p>	
						</dd>
						<dt>
							4) The Matrix (1999)
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								The 1999 film The Matrix is another landmark film in the history of special effects. 
								The sci-fi trilogy The Matrix's most astounding visual effect was "bullet time," which depicted 
								the action in a scene slowing down while the camera moved at a normal speed. Bullet time incorporates 
								one of the oldest special effects in movie history—time-slice photography—even though it appeared to 
								be a digital effect. With the help of editors, the "virtual camera movement" is produced by using a 
								bank of cameras to take a single still image.

					<h3>The different types of Special Effects in Movies</h3>
					<p class="intro">
						Special effects are techniques used in movies to create scenes that are impossible, impractical or 
						too expensive to film in reality. They can be divided into two main categories practical effects 
						and digital effects.
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>
							1) Practical Effects
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								Practical effects involve creating illusions that are done on set, using physical objects, props, 
								makeup, animatronics, pyrotechnics, etc. These effects are frequently used to give a scene a sense 
								of realism or tangibleness, and they are especially useful for depicting physical items like explosions, 
								creatures, and automobiles. By giving actors tangible objects to interact with on set, practical effects 
								can also aid actors get into character.
							</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							2) Digital Effects
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								Visual effects, often abbreviated as VFX, are those that are done in post-production using computer software 
								and digital techniques to create or enhance imagery that cannot be achieved through practical means such as 
								fantastical creatures, futuristic technology, magical powers, etc. These effects can range from simple production 
								of different elements to create a seamless shot, to complex simulations of physics, weather, or other natural events.

					<h3>The role of Special Effects in Movies</h3>
					<p class="intro">
						The role of special effects in movies is to create realistic and immersive scenes that would be impossible or impractical 
						to film in real life production. Special effects can enhance the storytelling, the mood, and the visual appeal of a movie. 
						They can also aid in expressing a film's genre, place, and theme. By giving viewers a more immersive and interesting 
						experience, it can improve a movie's narrative and emotional impact. When used effectively, special effects may aid in 
						bringing a director's vision to life on screen and let viewers connect with characters and plots in fresh and exciting ways.<br><br>
						One way that SFX can enhance a film's narrative is by creating a sense of realism that draws viewers 
						into the story. For example, in Gravity (2013), the use of CGI helped to create the illusion of weightlessness and danger 
						in outer space.<br>

					<h3>The future of Special Effects in Movies</h3>
					<p class="intro">
						Special effects are an essential part of movie making. They help create realistic and immersive worlds, characters and 
						scenes that would otherwise be impossible or too expensive to film. Movie special effects are anticipated to continue to 
						evolve and incorporate both practical and digital effects in the future.  <br><br>
						One major innovation is the use of virtual reality 
						and augmented reality to create immersive experiences between the real and digital worlds. 
						Motion capture technology has also advanced significantly in recent years, allowing filmmakers to capture more 
						detailed performances from actors that can then be translated into stunning effects on screen.  <br>
