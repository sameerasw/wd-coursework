Read Readme Plz

So simple thing I located these things as you structured all ur resources and stuffs in main 
(if my page has a folder name "css" then place all content in that folder in your "css" folder in main. All content in page 
(images, js and css file paths were set as it is, so no need to update places again))


** SPECIAL NOTE -

for now I unlinked the "css/style.css" and "js/script.js" cuz after linking them my pages doesn't seems to be functioning well....  
so It's a TODO

That's All. Good Work All !!!
